You can see a monument in his memory looking towards the castle from the top of Vitkov Hill, the site of the famous battle (he’s sitting on the third largest equestrian statue in the world). <br /><br />Žižkov was historically a working-class district, always showing a strong support for left-wing ideology. The 20th Century brought in a wave of artists and writers (Franz Kaftka used to visit his father’s workshop here), attracted by the low living costs and rich history of struggle. During the Second World War, the district saw considerable activity from the Czech resistance movement, such as sheltering the men who assassinated senior Nazi-Party member, Reinhard Heydrich. <br /><br />Mo\n",

Исторически верхняя часть данного района называется Жижков, которому в конце XVII века присвоили звание города, в 1922 году он стал районом Праги. В этот район вошла часть Виноградов, Высочан и Страшнице, в отличие от Жижкова, который единственный полностью находится на территории этой административной единицы.<br /><br />Изначально он считался пролетарским и с большим числом проживающих здесь цыган, а после присоединения к Праге он стал пользоваться вниманием буржуазии, теперь этот район довольно знаменит своей близостью к центру и одновременно соответствует духу простого чешского народа, который теряется среди дворцов и соборов Праги 1.<br /><br />Сейчас в этом районе любит селиться молодежь, приезжие студенты, иностранные\n",

Every team has its leaders, ours are Michal and Michael. Michal is the reason why our apartment looks so good. At first, he was focused on industrial design and later he gradually turned onto an automotive design. He had already worked for brands like BMW, McLaren and others, until joining small design team in the UK. Nowadays he still works on various projects in London while dedicating a growing portion of his time creating and operating the most amazing apartments in Prague. On the everyday site of the company is Michael. Thanks to his everyday work we are able to work perfectly together and provide you with the most pleasant stays in Prague possible. Instead of going to college he started working right after high school. At first, he was focusing on financial advisory, he was good and successful but it just wasn't \"it\". And so, he moved to Prague, where he teamed up with Michal and he started focusing on short-term lets in Prague. And the rest of the team? All of us are passionate travellers bored with superficial holiday resorts and fabricated touristic attractions. We love coming up with various ways how to improve your stay and turn it into a positive experience that you will remember.

      "\n",
      " For those who are attached to this bodily machine, the yoga system is recommended. One who is overly attached to the bodily conception is taught to concentrate the mind by some physical gymnastics. Thus in haṭha-yoga one undergoes various physical disciplines, but the real purpose is to understand Viṣṇu, the Supreme. The various yoga systems are given for the machine of the body, but the process of bhakti is transcendental to mechanical arrangements. It is therefore called tad-vijñāna, transcendental to material understanding. If one actually wants to understand spiritual life and spiritual knowledge, one has to approach a guru. The word guru means \"heavy,\" heavy with knowledge. And what is that knowledge? Tad-vijñāna. That heaviness is brahma-niṣṭhā—attachment to Brahman and to Parabrahman, Bhagavān.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spirit soul & reincarnation  :\n",
      "\n",
      " Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth — either material or spiritual — there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhīṣma nor for Droṇa, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one's work in life. So Bhīṣma and Droṇa, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.\n",
      "Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature — both material and spiritual — is called a dhīra, or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.\n",
      "The Māyāvādī theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained, on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul's being unchangeable. As confirmed in the Gītā, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (sanātana) and are called kṣara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation the individual soul remains the same — fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Paramātmā. He is different from the individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (māyā), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of māyā, no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by māyā. (Taken from Bhagavad -Gita as it is )\n",

      "Chanting Hare Krishna maha mantra is highest of all yogas:\n",
      "\n",
      "Advanced yogīs are not very much attracted to the rituals of the scriptures, but they automatically become attracted to the yoga principles, which can elevate them to complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest yoga perfection. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (3.33.7), such disregard of Vedic rituals by the advanced transcendentalists is explained as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, far advanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters. Such chanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices, bathed in all sacred places, and finished all scriptural studies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The famous example of this was presented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted Ṭhākura Haridāsa as one of His most important disciples. Although Ṭhākura Haridāsa happened to take his birth in a Muslim family, he was elevated to the post of nāmācārya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting three hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. And because he chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it is understood that in his previous life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the Vedas, known as śabda-brahma. Unless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot take to the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness or become engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord, Hare Kṛṣṇa.\n",
