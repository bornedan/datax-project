Every team has its leaders, ours are Michal and Michael. Michal is the reason why our apartment looks so good. At first, he was focused on industrial design and later he gradually turned onto an automotive design. He had already worked for brands like BMW, McLaren and others, until joining small design team in the UK. Nowadays he still works on various projects in London while dedicating a growing portion of his time creating and operating the most amazing apartments in Prague. On the everyday site of the company is Michael. Thanks to his everyday work we are able to work perfectly together and provide you with the most pleasant stays in Prague possible. Instead of going to college he started working right after high school. At first, he was focusing on financial advisory, he was good and successful but it just wasn't \"it\". And so, he moved to Prague, where he teamed up with Michal and he started focusing on short-term lets in Prague. And the rest of the team? All of us are passionate travellers bored with superficial holiday resorts and fabricated touristic attractions. We love coming up with various ways how to improve your stay and turn it into a positive experience that you will remember. We love experiencing new things and meeting new people, appreciating good quality of living and seeing new cities/places genuinely and with fun. Our goal is to bring the same to you.\n",
